## About

I am a Bachelor of Science degree holder in Animal and Environmental Biology, from the University of Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria. Shortly before my graduation, during my industrial training days in the university, I nurtured the desire to build a career path in Health, Environment and Safety(HSE). I went ahead to acquire the neccessary certifications that helped to boost this career path, and i enjoyed working in that capacity for as long as it lasted. But the last four years has seen me suffer tremendously from 'Job Dissatisfaction'. From being under-payed to being unappreciated by my former employer and even to feeling used, I started nurturing second thoughts about a career change.

Fast-forward to this day, a lot of things in the system have changed globally and which has also helped to shape my views and perspectives about a 'career switch'. The covid pandemic became a real eye-opener in helping me see that there is more certainty in the 'Tech-world' than anyhere else. So after becoming a victim of 'redundancy' in my previous workplace, i have decided to channel all my energy and focus to acquiring a tech-skill that will sustain me through the end of times.

I recently found out about 'Tech Expert Academy' and the lots of chances, opportunities and hope they offer to people. I am very much interested in becoming an expert in "Cloud Solutions". Considering that i do not have such a good foundation in tech, I am aware it won't be such an easy journey for me. But i also know that i have a strong skill in learning quick too. I sincerely want to give it my best shot with this new career path, given the demand for this skill in the world. I really look forward to applying myself to all the trainings, coachings and exposures I will be given in "Tech Expert Academy". In the end, I want to be able to 'confidently' profer 'Cloud Solutions' to the tech world at large. I really look forward to this great transition in my career, if given the opportunity.
